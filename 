Wrote UNOPTIMAL Function for Checking Graph Connectivity

First off function is in o(n^3) runtime, super
slow. Second of all, it has not yet been
tested on a smaller adj matrix. Third of all, the
kneighbors_graph needs a lot of memory allocation
so we need to convert each type into something
else first, like a bool.  

Also added json files from Jesses pixplot with
 metadata
